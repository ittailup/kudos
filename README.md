link sharing in angularjs
this is a scaffolded app built by yeoman on angularjs. it's the first part of a recommendation network using (hellobar)[https://www.hellobar.com/] style pop-ups.

# angularjs project important files
- most changes on app/ directory

### index.html
- added a few external libraries

### scripts/app.js
- added new modules to initialise

### scripts/controllers/main.js
- most of the magic happens here, linkscontroller and firebase service

### views/main.html
- main html template, holds the active div on the app
